## What

This program processes numbers in different numeral systems (binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal), validates their correctness, performs arithmetic operations, and calculates a final sum in decimal format. It is designed for computational accuracy and efficient handling of mixed-base numbers, making it ideal for educational and practical applications.

## Why

Dealing with numbers in multiple numeral systems is complex and prone to errors. This program automates the entire process, including base validation, conversion, and arithmetic operations, ensuring accuracy and saving time for developers, students, and engineers who work with such tasks.

## How

The program is implemented in C, leveraging its efficiency and low-level control for computational tasks. The workflow includes:
1. **Input Handling**: Reads input data containing numbers in various bases and their respective base types.
2. **Validation**: Ensures all inputs conform to the rules of their specified numeral systems.
3. **Conversion**: Converts each number to its decimal equivalent using base-specific logic.
4. **Arithmetic Operations**: Applies operations to increment odd-indexed numbers and decrement even-indexed numbers.
5. **Output**: Computes and displays the final sum in decimal format, or outputs "Invalid inputs" for any detected errors.

The program is built with structured error handling, ensuring robustness and clarity in the output.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: `C`
- **Numerical Processing**: `Base Conversion Logic`
- **Input/Output Handling**: `File-Based`
- **Deployment**: Local Execution for Educational and Practical Use
