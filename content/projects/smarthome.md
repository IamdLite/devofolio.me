## What

This Smart Home Management System is a Java application designed to manage various smart devices, including lights, cameras, and heaters. It allows users to control device states, such as turning devices on/off, adjusting brightness or temperature, setting camera angles, and managing charging status. The application provides a streamlined interface to simulate and manage a smart home efficiently.

## Why

Smart home systems are becoming increasingly complex, with multiple devices requiring precise and coordinated management. This application simplifies the process by providing a structured and intuitive system for controlling smart devices. It also serves as an educational tool, demonstrating object-oriented programming principles and device management simulations in Java.

## How

The program is implemented in Java, following object-oriented programming principles. It uses structures such as classes, enums, and methods to represent and manage devices. Key features include:

1. **Device Management**: Controls devices like lights, cameras, and heaters, including their states and attributes.
2. **Rules Enforcement**: Implements rules for device operations, such as valid temperature ranges, allowable brightness levels, and camera angle adjustments.
3. **Command Execution**: Supports commands for actions like turning devices on/off, starting/stopping charging, setting brightness/temperature, and recording status.
4. **Status Display**: Provides a comprehensive status overview of all devices in the system.

The application ensures robust error handling and informative feedback for invalid commands or states, making it reliable and user-friendly.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: `Java`
- **Design Principles**: `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)`
- **Input/Output Handling**: `Command-Line Interface`
- **Deployment**: Local Execution for Simulations and Demonstrations
