## What

This application simulates animal life in a jungle. It educates and demonstrates the complex interactions between herbivores, carnivores, omnivores, and their environment. The simulation allows users to explore:
- Animal behaviors such as eating, hunting, and energy management.
- Grass growth and its consumption by herbivores and omnivores.
- Unique sound behaviors for different animal types (e.g., Lion: "Roar", Zebra: "Ihoho", Boar: "Oink").

This project is built to understand ecosystems, predator-prey dynamics, and how energy flows in a simulated natural environment.

## Why

The Forest Simulator is designed to demonstrate programming principles like object-oriented programming, inheritance, and simulation design while inspiring curiosity about animal life. It uses UML-based design to model the interactions between entities effectively.

## How

The simulation is implemented in Java, adhering to a UML design for animal types and their behaviors. It processes user-provided input data such as the number of simulation days, grass amount, and animal attributes to compute and display the simulation results dynamically. The simulation outputs exceptions, animal actions, and sounds, adhering to realistic behaviors.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: `Java`
- **Framework**: `Java Standard Library`
- **Database**: `In-Memory Data Storage`
- **Deployment**: Local or Web (for educational purposes)

## Features

- Circular queue-based simulation of animals with adjustable parameters.
- Dynamic grass growth and consumption with realistic constraints.
- Exception handling for invalid inputs and unexpected behaviors.
- Configurable animal types and properties.
- Interactive and educational interface for learners.
